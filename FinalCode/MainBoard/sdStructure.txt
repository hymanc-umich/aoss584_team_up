SD Structure
This document outlines the basic structure for the
generally confusing SD/MMC data logging system
built on top of ChibiOS

=== Data Logger Application ===
This application manages logfile instance creation and writing

=== FATFS ===
Middle Layer FAT Filesystem API

=== Low Level Driver ===
HAL MMC-SPI Driver MMCD
    SPI Driver SPID
    
    
General order of things:
1. Initialize SPI and MMC-SPI drivers
2. Mount FAT-32 FS
3. Pass file system/driver to data logger
